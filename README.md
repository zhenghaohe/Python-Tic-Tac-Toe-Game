# Python-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic Tac Toe Game with simple AI written in Python.

To Run, Download file , open in shell as python tictac.py 

Works with usual rules.

Randomly decides whether the player goes first or the AI goes first

The AI checks if any possible move can allow itself to win. Otherwise, it checks if it must block the playerâ€™s move. Then the AI simply chooses any available corner space, then the center space, then the side spaces. 

Will update this in the coming days
